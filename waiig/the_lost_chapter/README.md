# Writing An Interpreter In Go: The Lost Chapter. A Macro System For Monkey.

In this folder you'll find "The Lost Chapter" in several different formats:

* PDF
* ePub, for reading in iBooks
* mobi, for Kindles and the Kindle app
* HTML, for reading it in the browser

In the `code` folder you'll find the all the code used and mentioned in "The
Lost Chapter".

In the `code` folder there is a subfolder `05`, that contains the code for the
complete Monkey interpreter as it would look like at the end of this "Lost
Chapter". It's called `05` because this lost chapter builds directly upon the
first four chapters of "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and can be thought of as
the chapter 5.

The code should be compilable and runnable if you set your $GOPATH to the `05`
folder. The `05` folder also contains an `.envrc` file. If you have direnv
(http://direnv.net/) installed then the $GOPATH should be automatically set for
you as soon as you `cd` into the directories.

If you have any question, send me an email: me@thorstenball.com

Enjoy!
